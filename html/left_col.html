						<p>In this scenario, one user (Carl Sagan) is subscribed to the "silver" level of access, which means he will be able to access the /planets endpoint with his access token by virtue of the "http://myapp.com/scp/silver" scope. Okta will mint the access token and include the "http://myapp.com/scp/silver" scope because Carl belongs to the "silverSubscribers" group in Okta.</p>

						<p>Similarly, another user (Jodie Foster) is subscribed to the "gold" level of access, which means she will be able to access the /moons endpoint, and she will also be able to access the /planets endpoint by virtue of the scopes included in her access token.</p>

						<p>Try clicking on the buttons as an unauthenticated user, and then as Carl and Jodie to get a sense of how the access tokens work with the API endpoints.</p>
