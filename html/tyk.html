				<h4>Okta + Tyk</h4>

				<p>In this example, Tyk is proxying the Okta "solar system" API. For each endpoint, Tyk is looking for a valid jwt. Tyk controls access to API endpoints via Tyk policies. Each of these policies has a unique id. This policy id must be included in a "policy" claim in the jwt in order for Tyk to allow access to the requested endpoint.</p>
