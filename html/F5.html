				<h4>Okta + F5 OIDC</h4>

				<p>In this example, F5 is a reverse proxy in front of the solar system application. The F5 appliance will check for a valid local session for the user. If the user does not have a local session, F5 will redirect the user to Okta to authenticate (OIDC). Okta will redirect the user back to F5 after successful authentication, and then F5 will serve the application.</p>
