				<h4>Okta + F5 OIDC</h4>

				<p>In this example, we are treating the Solar System resources as an application, rather than as an API with discrete resources. F5 is a reverse proxy in front of the solar system application. The F5 appliance will check for a valid access token in any request to the application, and will pass through valid requests.

				So, in this case, Carl Sagan will be able to access both endpoints.
